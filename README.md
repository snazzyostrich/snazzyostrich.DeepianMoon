A tiny little moon that moves about Giant's Deep named Flotsam Wake!
This completely invalidates the Nomai's choice to put the cannon around Giant's Deep!
It is an analog of Io.
It is slowly being torn apart by Giant's Deep, and lava will rise throughout the moon as the game progresses.
There are volcanoes that will shoot you up into the air when you least expect it.
It holds no Nomai artifacts or writings as of now.
